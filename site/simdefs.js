/**
 * simdefs.js — the simulations themselves. The player lives in sims.js.
 *
 * Each definition registers into window.__SIMS and is drawn with the helper
 * exposed as window.__SIM_D. Definitions are independent blocks: adding a new
 * sim never touches an existing one, and never touches the build.
 *
 * The rule:
 *   THE FRAMES MUST BE THE REAL MECHANISM, IN THE REAL ORDER.
 * Every number on screen is computed from a stated configuration, not typed in
 * to look plausible. If a mechanism has no genuine time axis, it does not get a
 * sim — a fake timeline over a static formula teaches motion that is not there.
